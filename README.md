# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Regression-and-Classification

This is a Jupyter notebook file that contains code to implement logistic regression and regularized logistic regression to solve two different problems.
The first problem is to predict whether a student will be admitted to a university based on their scores on two exams, using historical data from previous applicants.
The second problem is to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant pass quality assurance (QA) based on results from two tests.

The notebook is divided into two main parts. In the first part, the logistic regression model is implemented from scratch. 
The steps include loading and visualizing the data, implementing the sigmoid function, cost function, gradient function, and the function for learning parameters 
using gradient descent. The notebook also includes code for plotting the decision boundary and evaluating the logistic regression model.

In the second part, the regularized logistic regression model is implemented to solve the microchip QA problem.

The steps include loading and visualizing the data, feature mapping, implementing the cost function, gradient function, and the function for learning parameters
using gradient descent. The notebook also includes code for plotting the decision boundary and evaluating the regularized logistic regression model.
